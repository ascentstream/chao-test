## Namespace to deploy operator
# NOTE: Make the default namespace as empty. So it will fallback to use the namespace used for installing the helm
#       chart. Helm does not position it self as a namespace manager, as namespaces in kubernetes are considered as
#       a higher control structure that is not part of the application.
